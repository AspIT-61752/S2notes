## DataTypes
We call datatypes types, because that includes like int, float, char, string but also struct types. 
###### Note: If you get an error about a **Token** it's probably because your property has a number or an invalid character as/in it's identifier. 

| Access modifier | type | Identifier  | Statement terminator |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| public          | int  | AgeOfCheese | ;                    |

Someones Law. Everything that's public starts with a capitalized letter.
`public string FullName;` or `private iny rolls;`
